Menu
	Needs overhaul:
		Currently menu is implemented as a series of modal dialogs,
		this makes it difficult to mouse over in menu bar to show a new menu
	Action needs to be taken after dismissing menu.
	Need support for menu keys, and allow for '&' to select key.
	Allow for disabled menu items.
	Allow for separator.
	
Create dynamic menu to show current windows

Window
	Change order
		Bring to top.
		Move and uncover (ie invalidate) other windows.
		
Buttons

Shadow on windows
	
Closing by 'X' causes Ctrl+C ???
